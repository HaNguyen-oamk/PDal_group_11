# Unity Voice Command Game 🎮🗣️

## 🧩 Introduction

**Unity Voice Command Game** is a PC demo project that demonstrates how to control a **2D/3D** (**evaluating two options**) game character using **voice commands** in **English**.  
The player can say words like **"run"**, **"walk"**, **"jump"**, **"turn left"**, **"turn right"**, **"go forward"**, **"go back"**, **"shoot"**, or **"attack"**, and the character reacts in real time.
In addition to voice control, the character can also be operated using standard **keyboard inputs**.

This project focuses on **Unity**, **C#**, and simple **speech recognition** integration for **desktop (Windows)** environments.
